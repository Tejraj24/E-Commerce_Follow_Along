### Milestone 8: Product Card Component

## Overview

In Milestone 8, we focus on creating a reusable product card component and designing a homepage to display a collection of these cards. Each card will showcase key product details, such as the product's name, price, and image. The goal is to create a clean and organized layout that improves the user experience and allows for easy browsing of products. This milestone demonstrates the principles of component-based design and how to efficiently manage dynamic content within your app.

## Features

Reusable Product Card: A single card component that accepts dynamic product details as props and renders them in a uniform, visually appealing way. The product card includes:

1. Product name
2. Product image
3. Product price

Dynamic Rendering: Use of JavaScript array mapping to iterate through a list of products and dynamically render each product's card with its respective data.
Homepage Layout: A structured layout, designed using either CSS Grid or Flexbox, to display multiple cards on the homepage in a responsive, organized manner.
Consistent Design: The card component ensures that the product details are presented consistently across all cards, providing a seamless user experience
